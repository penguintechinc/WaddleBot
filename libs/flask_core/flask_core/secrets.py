"""
Fail-Closed Secret Loading
===========================

Security audit finding C1 (A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures / CWE-798
Hardcoded Credentials): ~47 services across this monorepo read
``SECRET_KEY`` (the HS256 key that signs and verifies every JWT --
``auth.create_jwt_token``/``verify_jwt_token``) via
``os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", "change-me-in-production")``. Any deploy that
forgets to set ``SECRET_KEY`` silently boots with a public, hardcoded
signing key -- anyone can forge a token, including a ``global:admin``
scope bundle or an arbitrary ``tenant`` claim (security.md Tenant
Isolation is a hard boundary only if the signature actually proves
authenticity).

:func:`require_secret_key` is the one place this is fixed: unset or
still-a-known-placeholder in a production-like environment refuses to
return a value at all -- the caller (almost always a module-level
``Config`` class body, evaluated at process import) propagates the
raised error and the service never finishes starting, rather than
serving traffic signed with a public key.

Two things keep this from also fail-closing every test suite and the
local dev stack that already assert on the literal placeholder string:

- A live ``pytest`` process (detected via ``sys.modules``, the standard
  no-conftest-changes-required technique) is never treated as
  production, regardless of ``RELEASE_MODE``/``ENVIRONMENT`` -- ~50
  test suites across the repo keep working unmodified. A test that
  wants to exercise the fail-closed path itself does so explicitly via
  the ``require`` parameter (see :func:`require_secret_key`), the same
  override shape ``workload_identity.IdentityProvider.connect(require=...)``
  already uses for its own fail-safe posture check.
- Outside pytest, production posture is resolved via
  ``workload_identity.is_production()`` -- the same "House fail-safe
  posture check" every other identity/security gate in this library
  uses, so a misconfigured deploy (no ``RELEASE_MODE``/``ENVIRONMENT``
  set at all) still fails closed by default rather than assuming dev.
