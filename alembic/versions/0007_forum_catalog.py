"""Register + tenant-wide activate the community forums app bundle.

Ports `config/postgres/migrations/091_community_forums_bundle.sql` into
Alembic -- that raw SQL file was never applied (0001_baseline only replays
legacy SQL files against a genuinely fresh DB; this DB's `schema_migrations`
table already had entries when 0001 ran, so the file-by-file loop was
skipped entirely). Without this row in `app_catalog`, svc_action never
subscribes to `waddles.community.forums.default`'s `:action` Valkey key and
`community_forums_action.create_forum_post` is never invoked. Without the
matching `app_tenant_availability` row, the bundle is registered but not
activated for any tenant. Activation is tenant-wide via
`app_tenant_availability` (matching the currently-active community/social
bundles seeded by migrations 088 and 093), not per-community
`app_activations`.
