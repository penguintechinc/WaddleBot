# App Bundle SDK Design Specification

Status: **DRAFT — for review, not implementation.** Extends
`docs/plans/2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md` (the "Apps" and "Deployment" sections) with
the packaging, coexistence, and lifecycle model needed before any bundle SDK code is written.
Every "today" claim below cites the real file/line it is grounded in; every new field or
table is a **proposal**, called out as such.

---

## 1. Overview

**An App Bundle *is* the App** — not a grouping of multiple Apps. A bundle is the packaged
combination of `{config + spec + script}` for each pipeline stage (`ingest` / `process` /
`action`) plus one top-level manifest (`bundle.yaml`). A bundle may implement 1, 2, or all 3
stages; it omits directories for stages it doesn't touch. This is the authoring-time
counterpart to the runtime `AppManifest` dataclass already defined in
`libs/flask_core/flask_core/app_manifest.py:93-114`.

Pipeline: **ingest →[Valkey queue]→ process →[Valkey queue]→ action** — a queue at *every*
stage boundary, not just the first. `svc-ingest` / `svc-process` / `svc-action`
(`docs/plans/2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:496-511`) are the three generic stage-runner
containers — they carry no bundle-specific code, only the loader that reads each activated
bundle's manifest and dispatches to its stage script. process→action is a second queue hop,
never a direct call: each stage publishes onto the next stage's own Valkey stream (§3.2's
`produces`/`consumes`, §6.2's isolation keys) and only that stream connects them. A slow or
long-running `action` handler backs up its *own* action-stage queue — bounded, spilling to the
DLQ on overflow (`stream_pipeline.py:368-438`) — without back-pressuring or blocking `process`
or `ingest`. Every stage is fully decoupled and scales independently.

**What changes from the current single-winner model**: `app_binding.py`'s `resolve_app`
(`app_binding.py:92-133`) picks exactly **one** App per `(tenant, community, feature)` slot.
This spec replaces that with **coexistence** — a community activates a *set* of bundles per
Feature (e.g. 4 giveaway bundles running side by side), each isolated by its own stream
namespace, config, and state, with conflicts resolved by an explicit
`compatible_with`/`incompatible_with` declaration rather than the binding ladder picking a
winner.

Term is always **ingest** — never receiver/integration.

## 2. Bundle anatomy

```
giveaway-classic/
├── bundle.yaml                  # top-level manifest (§3)
├── ingest/
│   ├── handler.py                # entry point (§4)
│   ├── config.yaml               # default config for this stage
│   └── spec.yaml                 # stage contract: consumes/produces, scopes
├── process/
│   ├── handler.py
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── spec.yaml
└── action/
    ├── handler.py
    ├── config.yaml
    └── spec.yaml
```

A bundle implementing only `process` + `action` (e.g. a pure moderation-decision bundle
triggered by another bundle's ingest) omits the `ingest/` directory entirely — `bundle.yaml`'s
`stages` map only lists what exists, mirroring how `surfaces` today is an optional, possibly-
partial tuple (`app_manifest.py:110`, `parse_manifest` never requires all three).

---

## 3. Manifest schema (`bundle.yaml`)

### 3.1 Field table

| Field | Type | Today (file:line) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app_id` | str, `waddles.<module>.<feature>.<app>` | `app_manifest.py:104`, `_APP_ID_RE` line 57 | unchanged |
| `name` | str | `app_manifest.py:105` | unchanged |
| `version` | SemVer str | `app_manifest.py:106`, `_SEMVER_RE` line 61-66 | unchanged |
| `feature` | str, `waddles.<module>.<feature>`, must equal `app_id`'s prefix | `app_manifest.py:107`, checked line 169-175 | unchanged |
| `module` | str, one of `KNOWN_MODULES` | `app_manifest.py:108`, set at line 35-47 | unchanged |
| `provider` | `builtin` \| `thirdparty` | `app_manifest.py:109`, `KNOWN_PROVIDERS` line 53 | unchanged — **authorship** axis |
| `is_default` | bool | `app_manifest.py:113` | unchanged |
| `config_schema` | dict | `app_manifest.py:112` | unchanged |
| `permissions` | tuple[str] | `app_manifest.py:111` | **renamed** to `requires_scopes` in bundle.yaml (design doc's own term, `2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:409`) — reconciliation in §3.3 |
| `surfaces` | tuple of stage **names** only, `{ingest,process,action}` | `app_manifest.py:110,51` | **superseded** by `stages` map (§3.2) — `AppManifest.surfaces` stays as a derived compat field |
| `execution_model` | `native` \| `thirdparty` | — | **NEW** — how the bundle runs, orthogonal to `provider` (a `builtin` bundle may still front a `thirdparty` endpoint, e.g. wrapping a SaaS API) |
| `compatible_with` | list[app_id], optional | — | **NEW** (§6) |
| `incompatible_with` | list[app_id], optional | — | **NEW** (§6) |
| `platform_compatibility` | object (§3.4) | — | **NEW** |
| `stages` | map, keyed by stage name (§3.2) | — | **NEW** — richer replacement for `surfaces` |

### 3.2 `stages` map

```yaml
stages:
  ingest:
    entrypoint: "ingest/handler.py:on_event"   # native only
    consumes: []                                # ingest has no upstream stream
    produces: ["giveaway.entry_detected"]
    config: "ingest/config.yaml"
    spec: "ingest/spec.yaml"
  process:
    entrypoint: "process/handler.py:on_event"
    consumes: ["giveaway.entry_detected"]
    produces: ["giveaway.winner_selected"]
    config: "process/config.yaml"
    spec: "process/spec.yaml"
  action:
    entrypoint: "action/handler.py:on_event"
    consumes: ["giveaway.winner_selected"]
    produces: []
    config: "action/config.yaml"
    spec: "action/spec.yaml"
```

Third-party stage — no `entrypoint`, an endpoint instead (fields lifted directly from
`marketplace_modules` columns added in `059_marketplace_consolidation.sql:15-22` and consumed
by `vendorExecutionService.executeCommand()`, `vendorExecutionService.js:25-102`):

```yaml
stages:
  action:
    execution_model: thirdparty
    communication_model: webhook_push        # or rest_pull
    webhook_url: "https://vendor.example.com/hook"
    webhook_secret: "${SECRET:vendor_hmac}"   # penguin-sal reference, never inline
    webhook_timeout_ms: 5000
    consumes: ["giveaway.winner_selected"]
    produces: []
```

Per the design doc (`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:416-417`): *"a first-party App may
span stages; a third-party App never does — it is reached over the network from whichever
stage invokes it."* A `thirdparty`-`execution_model` stage entry is therefore always a
single-stage block; a bundle mixing native `process` + thirdparty `action` is valid (native
stage calls out to the endpoint at the process→action stream boundary), but a single stage
block is never half-native/half-network.

### 3.3 `permissions` → `requires_scopes` reconciliation

`AppManifest.permissions` (`app_manifest.py:111`) is the only scopes-shaped field that exists
today. The design doc's own example manifest (`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:409`) already
called this `requires_scopes`. This spec adopts `requires_scopes` as the bundle.yaml field
name and treats `AppManifest.permissions` as the field `parse_manifest` populates from it —
either rename `permissions` → `requires_scopes` on `AppManifest` itself, or keep `permissions`
internally and alias at parse time. Pick one at implementation time (not decided here).

**Enforcement**: `requires_scopes` MUST be a subset of the declared Feature's
`FeatureContract.requires_scopes` (`feature_contract.py:86`). A bundle cannot claim scopes its
Feature contract doesn't grant — checked at `parse_manifest` time once the Feature contract is
resolvable, new validation not present in `app_manifest.py` today.

### 3.4 `platform_compatibility`

```yaml
platform_compatibility:
  tested_with: "v3.0.x"      # informational, matches release/v{Major}.{Minor}.X naming
  min_version: "3.0.0"        # SemVer, inclusive
  max_version: "3.999.999"    # SemVer, inclusive; omit for open-ended (discouraged)
```

Modeled on npm `engines`. `min_version`/`max_version` reuse the existing `_SEMVER_RE`
(`app_manifest.py:61-66`) — no new version grammar. `tested_with` is free-text matching the
repo's own release-branch convention (`release/v{Major}.{Minor}.X`, see root `CLAUDE.md`).

There is currently **no single canonical "running platform version"** to compare against —
`libs/flask_core/flask_core/__init__.py:15` has `__version__ = "2.0.0"`, which is already
stale relative to the `release/v3.0.X` branch this spec lives on. Establishing that source is
itself part of the implementation work, not assumed here.

**Enforcement policy — OPEN DECISION, see §9.** Proposed default: block install/available/
activate transitions when the running platform version is outside `[min_version,
max_version]`; warn (log + surface in an admin UI) but allow when it's in-range but does not
match `tested_with`. Flagged because "block vs warn" at each boundary is a product decision,
not an engineering one.

### 3.5 bundle.yaml → `AppManifest` mapping

`bundle.yaml` is the authoring artifact; `AppManifest` (`app_manifest.py:93-114`,
`slots=True, frozen=True`) is the runtime object `parse_manifest` builds and `AppRegistry`
indexes (`app_registry.py:62-81`). Today's `parse_manifest` (`app_manifest.py:123-206`)
validates 7 things in order (semver, namespacing, module, feature-prefix, provider, surfaces)
— this spec adds three more validation steps to run in the same function: `execution_model`
membership, `compatible_with`/`incompatible_with` are known `app_id`s (checked against the
registry, not the manifest in isolation), and `platform_compatibility` semver well-formedness.
`stages` compiles down to `surfaces` (stage-name tuple, unchanged shape, for any code that
still only needs "does this bundle touch process") plus a new `stage_specs: Dict[str,
StageSpec]` field carrying entrypoint/consumes/produces/config per stage — `AppManifest` gains
this field; it does not replace `surfaces`.

---

## 4. Per-stage script contract

| Stage | Entry point receives | Emits onto | Config/secrets | Scopes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ingest` | raw platform event (Twitch/Discord/etc. payload or webhook body) + tenant/community context + this instance's `config.yaml` merged with runtime overrides (§5) | this bundle's isolated `process`-stage stream (§6.2) | `penguin-sal` reference in `config.yaml`, never inline value | `requires_scopes` declared for the `ingest` stage, always ⊆ bundle-level `requires_scopes` |
| `process` | one event off this bundle's isolated `process` stream, tenant/community context, config | this bundle's isolated `action`-stage stream, or the DLQ on poison (`stream_pipeline.py:368-438`, `move_to_dlq`) | same | same |
| `action` | one event off this bundle's isolated `action` stream | nothing (terminal) — or, for `thirdparty` execution, a network call per §7 | same | same |

Every handler is `async def` (`entrypoint: "module.py:function"`, awaited by the stage-runner
loader) per `backend-python.md`. Consumers **must be idempotent** — at-least-once delivery is
explicit platform policy (`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:561-563`); every event envelope
carries an id and handlers dedupe on it.

Tenant/community context is injected by the stage-runner from the resolved `AppInstallation`
row (§5), never read from the event payload — same tenant-trust boundary as
`security.md`'s "client cannot set tenant" rule.

---

## 5. Lifecycle: install → available → activate

Three tiers, narrowing global → tenant → community, with a hard **subset** invariant:
`activated ⊆ available ⊆ installed`.

| Tier | Scope | Meaning | Closest thing that exists today |
|---|---|---|---|
| **installed** | global/platform | which bundles exist on the platform at all | `AppRegistry` (`app_registry.py:49-110`) is in-memory only, load-once at startup (docstring lines 16-21) — no persisted "is this app_id permitted on this cluster" row |
| **available** | tenant | which installed bundles a tenant may activate | **gap** — `059_marketplace_consolidation.sql:22,64-65` added `tenant_id` to `marketplace_modules`/`marketplace_subscriptions`, but that scopes *ownership/submission*, not an explicit tenant allowlist |
| **activated** | community, a **SET** | which available bundles a community has turned on | `hub_module_installations` (`000_create_base_schema.sql:259-269`) already stores one row per `(community_id, module_id)` with its own `is_enabled` — the table itself is already set-shaped; the single-winner narrowing happens one layer up, in `resolve_app` |

### 5.1 Proposed schema (supersedes `hub_module_installations`, per
`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:293-294`: *"Renaming `hub_module_installations` to
`app_installations` is part of P1... only the name stops lying."*)

```sql
-- GLOBAL: installed
CREATE TABLE app_catalog (
    app_id                  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,          -- waddles.<module>.<feature>.<app>
    manifest_version        TEXT NOT NULL,              -- bundle.yaml `version`
    module                  TEXT NOT NULL,
    feature                 TEXT NOT NULL,
    provider                TEXT NOT NULL,               -- builtin | thirdparty
    execution_model         TEXT NOT NULL,               -- native | thirdparty
    is_default               BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    compatible_with          TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    incompatible_with        TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    platform_compatibility   JSONB NOT NULL,             -- {tested_with,min_version,max_version}
    status                   TEXT DEFAULT 'active',       -- active | deprecated | yanked
    installed_at              TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- TENANT: available
CREATE TABLE app_tenant_availability (
    id             SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
    app_id         TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES app_catalog(app_id),
    available      BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    config_defaults JSONB DEFAULT '{}',                  -- tenant-level override of bundle.yaml defaults
    UNIQUE(tenant_id, app_id)
);

-- COMMUNITY: activated (the set)
CREATE TABLE app_activations (
    id            SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    community_id  INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES communities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tenant_id     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),   -- denormalized, for ACL/stream scoping
    app_id        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES app_catalog(app_id),
    enabled       BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    config        JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    activated_by  INTEGER,
    activated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(community_id, app_id)
);
```

Enforcement (application layer, at write time — not expressible as a single SQL constraint
across three tables): inserting into `app_tenant_availability` requires the `app_id` to exist
in `app_catalog`; inserting into `app_activations` requires an *available* row for that
`(tenant_id, app_id)`. Exact migration path (rename vs new tables, backfill from
`hub_module_installations`/`marketplace_subscriptions`) is an **open decision**, §9.

### 5.2 Resolution: `resolve_app` → `resolve_apps`

`resolve_app` (`app_binding.py:92-133`) returns one `AppManifest`, narrowest-scope-wins.
Replace with:

```python
async def resolve_apps(
    feature: str, *, tenant: str, community: Optional[int],
    installations: InstallationLookup, registry: Optional[AppRegistry] = None,
) -> Sequence[AppManifest]:
    """Every *enabled, activated* App implementing `feature`, visible at (tenant, community).
    Community-scoped rows + tenant-wide rows both included (union, not override) — the
    binding ladder's narrowest-wins semantics no longer apply. Falls back to the Feature's
    shipped default only when the resulting set is empty."""
```

`InstallationLookup.find` (`app_binding.py:79-89`) is unchanged — it already returns
`Sequence[AppInstallation]`; `resolve_app` was the layer that collapsed it to one. `BindingError`
(`app_binding.py:33-39`) still applies to the empty-set-and-no-default case.

---

## 6. Coexistence and conflict resolution

### 6.1 Fan-out

For a given inbound event, `svc-ingest` calls `resolve_apps(feature, tenant, community, ...)`
and runs **every** returned bundle's `ingest` stage independently — each publishes onto its
own isolated `process` stream (§6.2), so `svc-process` and `svc-action` fan out identically at
their own stage boundary. Four giveaway bundles activated in one community means four
independent ingest→process→action runs per matching chat event, not one shared run.

### 6.2 Isolation keys

Today's stream naming is **two generations behind this proposal** — worth stating precisely
because both existing schemes are visible in the codebase and neither is per-app:

| Scheme | Source | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy, actually in code | `stream_pipeline.py:64-67,78-104` | `{stream_prefix}:{stream}` — default prefix `"waddlebot:stream"`, stream names like `"events:inbound"` — no tenant, no community, no app |
| Design-doc target, **not yet implemented** | `2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:571-573` | `waddles:t:{tenant}:{stage}` — tenant-scoped, but still one shared stream per stage across every bundle |
| **This proposal** | — | `waddles:t:{tenant}:c:{community}:app:{app_id}:{stage}` |

`{stage}` takes all three values independently — `ingest`, `process`, and `action` each get
their own stream under this key. The process→action queue hop (§1) is the stream at
`waddles:t:{tenant}:c:{community}:app:{app_id}:action` — `process` publishes there (its
`produces`), `action` consumes from there (its `consumes`); it is a stream like every other
boundary, never a direct call between the two stage-runner containers.

Config/state follow the same shape: `waddles:t:{tenant}:c:{community}:app:{app_id}:cfg` and
`:state`. Tenant-wide activations (`community_id IS NULL` in `AppInstallation`,
`app_binding.py:63,58-60`) use a literal `c:_tenant` segment rather than omitting the segment,
so every key is uniformly parseable. Consumer group naming: `{app_id}:{stage}-group`, per the
existing `create_consumer_group` mechanism (`stream_pipeline.py:440-493`) — unchanged
mechanism, new group-name convention.

This reconciles, not replaces, the design doc's tenant ACL-user scheme
(`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:586-599`, `waddles-t-{tenant}-{stage}`) — that stays a
per-(tenant, stage) credential; the stream *key* underneath it now also carries community and
app_id.

### 6.3 Conflict enforcement

`compatible_with`/`incompatible_with` (§3.1) are `app_id` lists, package-manager
`Provides`/`Conflicts`-style. Coexistence is the default (empty `incompatible_with` = no
restriction). Enforcement point: `app_activations` insert/update (§5.1) — before activating
`app_id` X in a community, check every currently-`enabled=true` row in that community for
`app_id` Y where `Y in X.incompatible_with OR X.app_id in Y.incompatible_with` (symmetric
check — a declares b incompatible is enough, regardless of which side declares it). A hit
blocks the activation with a typed error (same `REASON_*`-coded pattern as `ManifestError`/
`RegistryError`), not a silent skip. The community must deactivate the conflicting bundle
first — mutual exclusion is a manual choice, never auto-resolved.

`compatible_with` is currently unused by the enforcement rule above (conflict detection only
needs `incompatible_with`) — it is carried for future use as an explicit "these are known to
work together" allowlist, e.g. gating an integration test matrix. Whether it should instead
drive something enforced (like requiring at least one `compatible_with` entry present) is an
open question, not decided here.

---

## 7. Execution models

| | Native | Third-party |
|---|---|---|
| `execution_model` | `native` | `thirdparty` |
| Runs | in-process inside the stage-runner container, loaded via `entrypoint` | never in-process — always a network hop (`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:446-472`) |
| Stage scope | may span all 3 stages | always exactly one stage per manifest block (§3.2) |
| Transport | direct function call from the stage-runner's dispatch loop | `webhook_push` (we call them, HMAC-SHA256, `webhook_secret`) or `rest_pull` (we call their API, `api_key`/`oauth2_client_credentials` bearer, or HMAC fallback) — both implemented today in `vendorExecutionService.executeCommand()` (`vendorExecutionService.js:25-102`) |
| Auth | `requires_scopes` checked against the caller's JWT scopes, in-process | HMAC over payload (`webhook_push`) or bearer/HMAC per `auth_type` (`rest_pull`) — `059_marketplace_consolidation.sql:17-18,27-30` |
| Failure mode | exception → DLQ (`stream_pipeline.py:368-438`) | timeout (`webhook_timeout_ms`, default 5000ms) + non-2xx → DLQ; inherits network latency/failure the native path doesn't have |
| Isolation | shares the stage-runner process — sandboxing is an **open decision**, §9 | already isolated by construction (separate process/network boundary) |

---

## 8. Worked example: `giveaway` bundle

```
giveaway-classic/
├── bundle.yaml
├── ingest/{handler.py, config.yaml, spec.yaml}
├── process/{handler.py, config.yaml, spec.yaml}
└── action/{handler.py, config.yaml, spec.yaml}
```

`bundle.yaml`:

```yaml
app_id: waddles.bot.giveaway.giveaway-classic
name: "Giveaway (Classic)"
version: "1.0.0"
feature: waddles.bot.giveaway
module: bot
provider: builtin
execution_model: native
is_default: true
requires_scopes: ["bot.command:write", "bot.chat:read"]
compatible_with: []
incompatible_with: []
platform_compatibility:
  tested_with: "v3.0.x"
  min_version: "3.0.0"
  max_version: "3.999.999"
stages:
  ingest:
    entrypoint: "ingest/handler.py:on_event"
    consumes: []
    produces: ["giveaway.entry_detected"]
    config: "ingest/config.yaml"
    spec: "ingest/spec.yaml"
  process:
    entrypoint: "process/handler.py:on_event"
    consumes: ["giveaway.entry_detected"]
    produces: ["giveaway.winner_selected"]
    config: "process/config.yaml"
    spec: "process/spec.yaml"
  action:
    entrypoint: "action/handler.py:on_event"
    consumes: ["giveaway.winner_selected"]
    produces: []
    config: "action/config.yaml"
    spec: "action/spec.yaml"
```

Stage specs (`spec.yaml`), abbreviated:

- `ingest/spec.yaml`: watches chat for `!giveaway enter`; emits `giveaway.entry_detected {user_uuid, community_id, ts}` (PII-tokenized per `backend-database.md` — chat username resolved via the identity table, never carried in the event itself).
- `process/spec.yaml`: accumulates entrants per active giveaway window in this instance's isolated state key (`waddles:t:{tenant}:c:{community}:app:waddles.bot.giveaway.giveaway-classic:state`); on window close, picks a winner, emits `giveaway.winner_selected {winner_uuid, giveaway_id}`.
- `action/spec.yaml`: posts the winner announcement via the platform's outbound chat action.

Two queue hops, not one: `ingest.produces["giveaway.entry_detected"]` ==
`process.consumes["giveaway.entry_detected"]` is the ingest→process stream
(`...:giveaway-classic:process`); `process.produces["giveaway.winner_selected"]` ==
`action.consumes["giveaway.winner_selected"]` is the *second*, independent process→action
stream (`...:giveaway-classic:action`, §6.2). `action` can take as long as posting the
announcement takes without ever blocking `process` from picking the next window's winner —
it only backs up its own `:action` stream.

### 8.1 Coexistence — 4 giveaway bundles in one community

Community `C1` activates `giveaway-classic`, `giveaway-raffle`, `giveaway-milestone`,
`giveaway-sub-only` — 4 rows in `app_activations`, all `enabled=true`, all implementing
`waddles.bot.giveaway`. `resolve_apps("waddles.bot.giveaway", tenant=T, community=C1, ...)`
returns all 4. Each gets its own isolated stream set:

```
waddles:t:T:c:C1:app:waddles.bot.giveaway.giveaway-classic:{ingest,process,action,dlq}
waddles:t:T:c:C1:app:waddles.bot.giveaway.giveaway-raffle:{ingest,process,action,dlq}
waddles:t:T:c:C1:app:waddles.bot.giveaway.giveaway-milestone:{ingest,process,action,dlq}
waddles:t:T:c:C1:app:waddles.bot.giveaway.giveaway-sub-only:{ingest,process,action,dlq}
```

A `!giveaway enter` chat event is evaluated by all 4 ingest handlers independently — no shared
state, no interference, per §6.1/§6.2.

### 8.2 Conflict — 2 incompatible Twitch bundles

`waddles.bot.twitch-chat.official-eventsub` and `waddles.bot.twitch-chat.legacy-irc-bridge`
both implement `waddles.bot.twitch-chat` but cannot both hold the platform's single Twitch
IRC/EventSub connection for one channel. Each declares:

```yaml
# official-eventsub/bundle.yaml
incompatible_with: [waddles.bot.twitch-chat.legacy-irc-bridge]

Activating `legacy-irc-bridge` in a community that already has `official-eventsub` enabled is
rejected at the `app_activations` write (§6.3) — the community must deactivate one before the
other can be turned on.

## 9. Open decisions (for the user — not decided here)

| # | Decision | Why it's open |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Native-script sandboxing model** — subprocess, WASM, or a separate pod per activation, vs. today's implicit in-process trust | Community/third-party-authored *native* scripts running inside the shared `svc-ingest`/`svc-process`/`svc-action` process is a different trust boundary than the existing "vendor code never runs in our process" guarantee (`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:460-465`) — security-sensitive, needs an explicit call |
| 2 | **Config precedence** — bundle default (`config.yaml`) → tenant (`app_tenant_availability.config_defaults`) → community (`app_activations.config`) — confirm this is strictly narrowest-wins-overrides, and whether deep-merge or full-replace at each layer |
| 3 | **`bundle.yaml` ↔ `AppManifest` reconciliation** — rename `permissions`→`requires_scopes` on the dataclass itself, or alias at parse time (§3.3); same question for `surfaces` vs the new `stage_specs` field |
| 4 | **`compatible_with` as declared IDs vs. an exclusive "provides" capability** — current proposal is explicit `app_id` lists (package-manager style); an alternative is a `provides: [capability]` + "only one provider of a given exclusive capability may be active," which scales better as the catalog grows but is a bigger schema change |
| 5 | **Exact `app_installations`/`app_catalog`/`app_tenant_availability` migration** — new tables (as drafted, §5.1) vs. renaming `hub_module_installations` in place and adding the two new tiers around it; backfill plan for existing `hub_module_installations`/`marketplace_subscriptions` rows |
| 6 | **`platform_compatibility` enforcement policy** (§3.4) — block-out-of-range/warn-untested-in-range is a proposed default, not confirmed; also needs a canonical "running platform version" source, which doesn't exist today (`flask_core.__version__` is stale) |

## 10. What changes from today (gap list)

| Today | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `AppManifest.surfaces` — tuple of stage **names** only (`app_manifest.py:110`) | `stages` map in `bundle.yaml` with per-stage `entrypoint`/`consumes`/`produces`/`config`/`spec`; `AppManifest` gains `stage_specs`, keeps `surfaces` as a derived compat field |
| `resolve_app` — single winner, narrowest-scope-wins (`app_binding.py:92-133`) | `resolve_apps` — returns the full enabled/activated set for a feature; fan-out, not override |
| `hub_module_installations` (`000_create_base_schema.sql:259-269`) — one flat `(community_id, module_id)` table, conflates install/available/activate | 3-tier `app_catalog` / `app_tenant_availability` / `app_activations`, `activated ⊆ available ⊆ installed` enforced at the application layer |
| No conflict field anywhere in `marketplace_modules` or `AppManifest` | `compatible_with`/`incompatible_with` on `bundle.yaml`, enforced at `app_activations` write |
| `stream_pipeline.py`'s `{stream_prefix}:{stream}` (legacy) / design doc's `waddles:t:{tenant}:{stage}` (target, unimplemented) — neither is per-community or per-app | `waddles:t:{tenant}:c:{community}:app:{app_id}:{stage}` — full per-(community × app) isolation |
| No platform-version compatibility declaration anywhere in `AppManifest` or `marketplace_modules` | `platform_compatibility` (`tested_with`/`min_version`/`max_version`) on `bundle.yaml`, enforced at install/available/activate |
| `permissions` field name on `AppManifest` (`app_manifest.py:111`) vs. `requires_scopes` in the design doc's own example (`2026-08-26-v3-scbm-apps-design.md:409`) | one name, `requires_scopes`, used consistently in `bundle.yaml` (§3.3) |
