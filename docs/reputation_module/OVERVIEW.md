# Reputation Module

> FICO-style reputation scoring system with event-driven processing, premium weight customization, and automated policy enforcement.

## Purpose

The Reputation Module maintains a comprehensive reputation scoring system for community members using a FICO-inspired 300-850 scale. It processes user behavior events (messages, subscriptions, raids, etc.) and applies configurable weights to calculate reputation scores and tier assignments (Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor). The module supports both community-scoped and global reputation tracking, enables premium weight customization for communities, and automatically enforces policies like auto-banning based on reputation thresholds. Integration with the Security Core Module enables coordinated moderation actions.
