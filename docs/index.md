# WaddleBot Documentation

Welcome to the WaddleBot documentation! WaddleBot is a multi-platform chat bot system with a modular, microservices architecture designed for Discord, Twitch, and Slack communities.

## What is WaddleBot?

WaddleBot is a comprehensive chat bot framework built for scalability and extensibility. The system consists of:

- **Core Components**: Central API layer with routing, marketplace, and identity management
- **Collector Modules**: Platform-specific modules that receive webhooks/chat from platforms
- **Interaction Modules**: Modular functionality executed in containers or serverless functions
- **Administration Tools**: Community management portal and admin interfaces

## Key Features

### üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture**
- Microservices-based design with independent, scalable components
- Docker containerization with Kubernetes orchestration
- Horizontal scaling with dynamic server/channel assignment

### üåê **Multi-Platform Support**
- **Discord**: Native py-cord integration with slash commands and events
- **Twitch**: EventSub webhooks with OAuth and Helix API integration
- **Slack**: Event API with slash commands and Socket Mode support

### ‚ö° **High Performance**
- Multi-threaded command processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Redis caching and PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Kong API Gateway for unified routing and rate limiting

### üîß **Extensive Functionality**
- AI-powered interactions with multiple provider support (Ollama, OpenAI, MCP)
- Music integration (YouTube Music, Spotify) with OBS browser sources
- Community management tools (inventory, calendar, memories, labels)
- Cross-platform identity linking and verification
