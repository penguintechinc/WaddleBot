# Documentation reference gate. Extracts every repository path referenced in
# backticks in docs/**/*.md and asserts each one still exists on disk.
#
# Docs go stale because nothing fails when they do. This is the failing thing:
# a `services/foo` in a doc that no longer exists on disk is a dead reference,
# and the count of dead references may not exceed DOC_REF_BUDGET.
#
# The budget is seeded at today's measured debt and ratcheted down, never up —
# existing debt stays visible without blocking work, and any NEW dead reference
# fails immediately.
#
# A run that extracts zero references is itself a FAILURE: a validator pointed
# at a moved directory finds nothing and reports clean. The denominator is part
# of the result, so it is guarded and printed.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (general.md) — no associative arrays, no mapfile.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-doc-refs.sh            full gate (make check-docs)
#        scripts/check-doc-refs.sh --count    print only the dead count (lint)
#        DOC_REF_BUDGET=N scripts/check-doc-refs.sh   override the budget
