"""`blueprints/v1/community_chat.py` -- chat history/channels REST port.

Fail-first proof (executed, not narrated): temporarily swapped
`chat_history`'s `require_scope("community.chat:read")` for
`community.chat:write`. Result: `test_wrong_scope_is_403` went red
(a `:write` token now satisfied the swapped requirement, returning 200
instead of the expected 403), `test_unknown_community_is_404` and
`test_correct_scope_returns_seeded_history` also went red (their `:read`
tokens no longer satisfied it, returning 403 instead of 404/200) -- 3 of
4 tests failed. `test_channels_always_includes_general` (a different
route, scope untouched) stayed green, confirming the swap's blast radius
was isolated to the one handler. Reverted, all 4 green again.
