"""`blueprints/v1/live_activity.py` -- list route + `/stream` route auth/tenant-scoping.

Reuses `community_db`/`auth_headers` from `tests/conftest.py` unchanged
(no new fixture needed). The SSE generator's own poll/emit/scoping
behavior is unit-tested directly in `tests/test_live_activity_service.py`
against `services.live_activity.event_stream` -- an infinite generator
can't safely be drained through `client.get()` (it would hang the test),
so this file only exercises `/stream`'s auth-gate and tenant-scoping
short-circuits (both return before the streaming `Response` is ever
constructed) plus the happy-path response shape (status/mimetype only,
never reading the body).
