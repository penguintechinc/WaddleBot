"""Community blueprints -- two-gate Feature guard proofs (SCCEBM per-capability flags).

Dedicated fail-first-verify coverage for the one-line `feature_enabled(...)`
guards added this PR to `community_chat.py`, `community_polls.py`,
`community_interaction.py` (both `community.interactions` and the
separate `community.forums` capability), and `community_loyalty.py` (the
one Professional-tier capability among this set). Every OTHER test file
for these blueprints (`test_community_chat.py` et al.) defaults the gate
ON via its own `_feature_enabled_default_on` autouse fixture and exercises
routing/scope/tenant/proxy behavior instead -- this file is the
complementary "the gate itself actually gates" proof, mirroring
`test_v1_analytics_blueprint.py`'s existing `feature_enabled` mocking
pattern for `analytics.community_health`.

Fail-first proof (executed, not narrated): temporarily reverted
`community_chat.py::chat_history`'s guard (removed the `if not await
feature_enabled(...)` block) and re-ran `test_chat_history_blocked_when_
flag_off` -- it went red (`assert 200 == 402`, the stubbed history
returned instead of the 402 gate). Reverted; green again.
