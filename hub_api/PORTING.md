# Porting a Node controller group into hub-api

The recipe M1 (Core Identity/Auth: auth, identity, passkey, userManagement,
profile) established for M2..M9. Read this before you start; it will save
you from re-discovering the gotchas in the "Hard-Won Gotchas" section the
slow way.

## The checklist (per controller group)

```
[ ] 1. Read the Node source: controllers/<X>Controller.js + its routes/<x>.js
       mount point + any services/*.js it calls. Grep
       admin/hub_module/frontend/src/services/api.js for every path your
       group owns -- that file is the pinned contract, byte-for-byte.
[ ] 2. Bind your group's pydal tables in services/schema.py's
       bind_<group>_tables(dal, *, migrate=False), called from
       app.py::_bind_reference_tables(). Add `migrate` bool default False
       (test fixtures pass migrate=True) -- see Gotcha #2 below.
       If your group needs new `tenants` columns, extend the ONE
       define_table("tenants", ...) call already in app.py -- never
       redefine the table.
[ ] 3. Service layer in services/<group>_service.py: one function per
       Node controller action, real logic (no dicts as data structures --
       @dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True) return types), pydal query
       builder ONLY (see Gotcha #1 -- raw SQL is Postgres-only here).
[ ] 4. Blueprint in blueprints/v1/<group>.py: route -> tenant_middleware
       (skip for pre-auth routes: login, register, oauth start/callback,
       refresh, public lookups) -> require_scope (skip for self-service
       routes on the caller's OWN resource -- see "Auth pattern" below)
       -> @validate_request/@validate_response DTOs (skip @validate_response
       specifically where Gotcha #3 bites -- use jsonify_dto() instead).
       Path + method IDENTICAL to the Node route. camelCase DTO field
       names where the JSON contract needs them (see "DTO casing" below).
[ ] 5. Add `services/<group>_service.py` and `blueprints/v1/<group>.py` to
       pyproject.toml's per-file-ignores ONLY for the specific, justified
       rules your group also needs (N815 for camelCase DTOs, S101 for
       postcondition asserts) -- copy the pattern already there for auth.py.
[ ] 6. Tests in tests/test_v1_<group>_blueprint.py: standalone Quart app
       registering only your blueprint (see "Test pattern" below), real
       JWTs, real pydal queries. At minimum: one auth-bypass (missing
       token -> 401) and, if your group has an admin-gated route, one
       scope-check (valid token, wrong scope -> 403) test, PLUS a written
       fail-first note (temporarily break the check, confirm the test
       goes red, revert, confirm green -- see any M1 test file's
       docstring for the format).
[ ] 7. `ruff check --fix . && ruff format . && mypy --strict services/
       blueprints/v1/<group>.py` -- must be clean before you open a PR.
[ ] 8. Run the FULL test suite (`pytest tests/`), not just your new file --
       confirm you haven't broken app_factory/router_discovery/openapi_docs
       (they assert on `/api/v1/auth/login`'s status code; M1 already
       updated them from 501 to 400 once the stub became real).
```

## Auth pattern (copy exactly)

| Endpoint shape | Decorators |
|---|---|
| Pre-auth (login, register, oauth start/callback, refresh, public tenant lookup) | none of tenant_middleware/require_scope -- there's no JWT yet |
| Self-service (caller acting on their OWN resource: own profile, own identities, own passkeys) | `@tenant_middleware` only -- see `services/current_user.py` for why `require_scope` doesn't apply here |
| Admin/elevated action (superadmin user CRUD, tenant admin actions) | `@tenant_middleware` + `@require_scope("<resource>:<action>")` |

Self-service routes need "who is calling" but `flask_core.tenancy.
TenantContext` only carries the tenant, not the subject. Use
`services.current_user.get_current_user_id(request)` (raises 401) or
`get_optional_current_user_id(request)` (returns `None`) -- both re-decode
the bearer JWT independently, same pattern `flask_core.authz.require_scope`
itself uses (see that module's own docstring for the rationale). Don't
thread a new field through `TenantContext` -- that's shared infra other
groups also build on.

## DTO casing

`app.py`'s `QuartSchema(app, ...)` does not set `convert_casing=True`
(confirmed by reading `quart_schema/extension.py` -- default `False`), so
there is no automatic camelCase↔snake_case conversion. Wire DTOs pinned to
`api.js`'s camelCase JSON (`avatarUrl`, `isSuperAdmin`, ...) need CAMELCASE
PYTHON FIELD NAMES verbatim -- this deliberately breaks normal PEP8
snake_case convention for these specific classes, matching what
`blueprints/v1/auth.py`'s DTOs already do. Add `N815` to your group's
per-file-ignore for this reason, not because the convention doesn't
matter elsewhere.

## Test pattern

Copy `tests/test_v1_auth_blueprint.py`'s shape: a `Quart(__name__)` +
`QuartSchema(app)` app registering ONLY your blueprint (not the full
`create_app()`), `app.config["dal"]`/`["async_dal"]` from the `auth_db`
fixture (`tests/conftest.py`), `app.config["HUB_API_CONFIG"]` from a
locally-built `HubAPIConfig`. `auth_headers`/`user_auth_headers` fixtures
mint real JWTs via `flask_core.auth.create_jwt_token` -- never hand-roll
one. If your group needs tables `bind_auth_tables()` doesn't already
cover, add your own `bind_<group>_tables()` call to `auth_db` (or a new
fixture) in `tests/conftest.py` -- additive only, never edit the M1
group's own fixture logic.

## Hard-Won Gotchas

### Gotcha #1 -- `async_dal`'s raw-SQL helpers are Postgres-only; use the pydal query builder

`flask_core.database.AsyncDAL.executesql_async()`/`.execute()` both
hardcode `%s` placeholders (psycopg2's paramstyle). Any raw SQL string
using `%s` will 500 with `sqlite3.OperationalError: near "%": syntax
error` the moment a test runs it against sqlite -- and
`backend-database.md` mandates supporting every `DB_TYPE`, not just
Postgres. **Use pydal's query builder for everything**, including JOINs
(`left=dal.other_table.on(...)`) and `DISTINCT`
(`select_async(dal(query), field, distinct=True)`) -- it's portable and
it's the only form these tests can exercise. `auth_service.py`,
`profile_service.py`, and `user_management_service.py` all had raw-SQL
call sites converted during the M1 port; read `list_users()` in
`user_management_service.py` for a WHERE-clause-with-optional-filters
example, or `get_my_profile()` in `profile_service.py` for a LEFT JOIN
example.

Second half of this gotcha: `select_async(query, ...)` expects `query` to
already be a pydal **`Set`** (i.e. `dal(condition)`), NOT a bare `Query`
(`dal.table.field == value`) -- passing a bare `Query` fails with
`AttributeError: 'Query' object has no attribute 'select'`.
`update_async`/`delete_async`/`count_async` self-wrap (`self.dal(query)`
internally) so a bare `Query` is correct there -- only `select_async` is
the odd one out. (`flask_core.auth.verify_api_key_async`'s own example
usage has this exact bug -- don't copy it.)

### Gotcha #2 -- `sqlite:memory` breaks the moment a route calls `async_dal.*_async()`

`AsyncDAL`'s DB calls run on its own `ThreadPoolExecutor` (a different OS
thread per call). SQLite's `:memory:` database is connection-scoped --
each new connection (i.e. each new executor thread) sees a BLANK
database, not the one the main thread just seeded. Symptom:
`sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: hub_users` even though you just
defined and inserted into it. `tests/conftest.py::tenant_db` (the
pre-M1 fixture) never hits this because `tenant_middleware` queries
`dal(query).select()` synchronously on the request thread, no executor
involved -- but the moment YOUR service layer calls `select_async`/
`insert_async`, you need a file-backed sqlite DB instead:
`AsyncDAL(f"sqlite://{tmp_path}/test.db", pool_size=1)` -- see
`tests/conftest.py::auth_db`. `pool_size=1` avoids a SECOND sqlite
footgun (`database is locked` from concurrent connections against a
non-WAL file).

Related: `bind_<group>_tables()` must accept `migrate: bool = False` and
thread it into every `dal.define_table(..., migrate=migrate)` call.
Production never migrates (schema owned by `config/postgres/migrations/`);
tests need `migrate=True` or pydal never issues the `CREATE TABLE` DDL at
all against the throwaway sqlite file, and every query 500s with
"no such table" regardless of the connection-scoping fix above.

Third related gotcha: `AsyncDAL.insert_async()`/`update_async()` never
call `.commit()`. Within a single test (a request through the app's own
`async_dal`, or a chain of `async_dal.*_async()` calls), this is invisible
-- every call in the chain shares the executor's one connection
(`pool_size=1`), so writes are visible to later reads on that SAME
connection even uncommitted. If a test instead asserts against a row via
the fixture's OWN synchronous `auth_db.dal(...)` query (a DIFFERENT
connection, the main thread's), an uncommitted insert from `insert_async`
is invisible and the assertion fails with a `None`/empty result that
looks like the insert silently failed. Fix: assert via
`await auth_db.select_async(auth_db.dal(query))` (same connection as the
write), not a bare synchronous `auth_db.dal(...)` call, when verifying an
`insert_async`/`update_async` write from a test.

### Gotcha #3 -- a specific `@validate_response` + real DB write + nested-dataclass response crashes

Confirmed, 100%-reproducible, isolated across 17 throwaway repro scripts
(not kept in this repo) against this repo's exact pinned versions
(pydantic 2.13.5 / pydantic-core 2.46.5 / quart-schema 0.25.0): a route
that awaits a real `async_dal.insert_async()` (or, in one case,
`update_async()`) and then returns a dataclass with a NESTED dataclass
field (e.g. `user: LoginUserDTO`) raises `TypeError: 'None' is not an
instance of 'SchemaSerializer'` from inside pydantic-core -- whether or
not `@validate_response` decorates the route, since quart-schema's
app-wide `make_response` hook runs `TypeAdapter(type(raw)).dump_python()`
on every response regardless of decoration.

Root cause NOT fully identified (time-boxed after exhausting: Optional
fields, GC timing, thread-pool warm-up order, bcrypt cost factor, import-
lock contention, dict-vs-dataclass, specific-table -- none of these were
it). It reproduces with `login()`-shaped flows in a minimal harness but
NOT through the real `/api/v1/auth/login` route, and does NOT reproduce
for flows that only `select`/`update` (never `insert`) before a nested
response. If you hit this (a route 500s with exactly this `TypeError` and
your DTO shapes look correct), don't spend a day on it like this PR did --
apply the workaround directly:

```python
from services.dto_response import jsonify_dto

@my_bp.route("/thing", methods=["POST"])
@validate_request(MyRequest)
# NOT @validate_response -- see services/dto_response.py's module docstring.
async def create_thing(data: MyRequest) -> tuple[Any, int]:
    ...
    return jsonify_dto(MyNestedResponse(success=True, thing=ThingDTO(...)))
```

`jsonify_dto()` builds a real `quart.Response` via `jsonify()`, which
`model_dump`'s internal branching leaves untouched (falls through to
`else: value = raw`) -- the crash never triggers. This is NOT a "raw
dict"/`**model.__dict__` violation of security.md's Output Validation
rule: the DTO's `dataclass(slots=True)` constructor already fixed the
exact field set before `dataclasses.asdict()` ever runs.

Routes fixed this way in M1: `register()`, `verify_email()` (auth.py);
`create_user()`, `update_user()`, `assign_analytics_consumer_role()`
(user_management.py); `update_my_profile()` (profile.py). Flat responses
(no nested dataclass field) and select-only routes were empirically
confirmed safe with normal `@validate_response` throughout M1's own test
suite -- don't apply `jsonify_dto()` everywhere defensively, only where a
failing test proves you need it.

### Gotcha #4 -- schema gaps between Node's code and the real migrations

Three columns Node's controllers reference don't exist in
`config/postgres/migrations/*.sql` (only in a separately-drifted
`config/postgres/init.sql` or nowhere at all): `hub_users.
email_verification_expires`, `hub_oauth_states.metadata`,
`platform_configs.enabled`. These are pre-existing gaps, not introduced
by the Python port -- Node's own code would 500 against the real
migrated schema too. `services/schema.py`'s module docstring documents
all three and the specific workaround chosen for each (bind the column
anyway to stay byte-faithful; for `hub_oauth_states.metadata`, drop the
tenant-scoped OAuth-state stashing and resolve against
`DEFAULT_TENANT_SLUG` instead of porting a call that would 500). If your
group hits a similar gap, follow the same pattern: document it, don't
silently invent a column, don't silently drop the whole feature either.

### Gotcha #5 -- `dal.tables` empty-route trick

`@blueprint.route("", methods=["GET"])` (empty string, not `"/"`) with a
non-empty `url_prefix` produces the prefix path EXACTLY, no trailing
slash -- e.g. `url_prefix="/api/v1/user/identities"` + `route("")` ->
`/api/v1/user/identities`. `route("/")` instead would register
`.../identities/` (trailing slash), a different path than Node's
contract. Confirmed via direct `app.url_map` inspection during the M1
port.

### Gotcha #6 -- a pydal `left=` JOIN's Row shape depends on how many tables you select fields from

`db(query).select(other_table.ALL, left=other_table.on(...))` (selecting
fields from only ONE table, even across a JOIN condition spanning two)
returns a FLAT `Row` -- access fields directly (`row.name`), not nested
under `row.other_table.name`. Nesting under `row.<tablename>.<field>`
only happens when you select fields from **two or more** tables together
(e.g. `dal.hub_users.ALL, dal.hub_user_profiles.ALL` -- see
`profile_service.get_my_profile()`). Confirmed empirically (an
`AttributeError` from pydal's `LazyReferenceGetter` when the nested
accessor is used on a single-table selection) while fixing Gotcha #7
below.

### Gotcha #7 -- SECURITY: OAuth state and email-based account linking are the two places a faithful Node port is NOT safe to ship

Two account-takeover bugs were caught in post-merge security review of
the M1 port -- both faithful ports of bugs that exist in Node's own
source today, not introduced by porting:

1. **`identity_service.py`'s original `_encode_link_state`/
   `_decode_link_state`** encoded the OAuth-link state as an UNSIGNED
   base64 JSON blob carrying `hubUserId` directly -- forgeable by any
   caller (craft your own blob naming a victim's id, complete your own
   OAuth flow, and the victim's account gets your OAuth identity linked
   to it; since OAuth login resolves by `(platform, platform_user_id)`,
   that identity then logs you into their account). **Fix: state MUST
   be an opaque token resolved from SERVER-SIDE storage** -- the same
   `hub_oauth_states` table (`user_id` column, single-use via `DELETE`
   on consume, TTL via `expires_at`) `oauth_service.start_link()`/
   `link_callback()` already use. Never decode a client-suppliable value
   to get a user id, full stop -- if your group has any "callback
   carries who this action is for" flow, it goes through server-side
   state, never a signed-or-not blob you decode.
2. **`oauth_service._find_or_create_user_from_oauth`** used to adopt an
   EXISTING `hub_users` row when the OAuth provider's claimed email
   matched, if no `(platform, platform_user_id)` link existed yet.
   Providers vary in whether that email is verified (some don't verify
   at all) -- an attacker registering an OAuth account with a victim's
   email got silently logged in AS the victim. **Fix: an email match
   with no existing identity link is a `409 conflict`, never an adopt.**
   New OAuth identity + no email collision -> create a new user.
   Existing OAuth identity link -> log in that user (safe, unchanged).
   Intentional cross-linking only happens through the AUTHENTICATED
   `/oauth/<platform>/link` flow, where the caller already proved who
   they are via their own session.

If your group has ANY flow resolving "which user does this unauthenticated
callback belong to" (OAuth, magic links, invite acceptance, ...), ask
explicitly: is the identity binding server-side, and does matching on a
provider-claimed attribute (email, username) ever silently merge into an
existing account instead of requiring an authenticated linking action?
See `tests/test_v1_oauth_security.py` for the fail-first regression tests.

### Gotcha #8 -- SECURITY: never put a session JWT in a redirect URL/query string

A third post-merge finding, same "faithful port of a Node bug" shape as
Gotcha #7: `oauth_callback` originally redirected with
`?token={jwt}` directly in the URL. Query strings leak into proxy/access
logs, browser history, and the `Referer` header of any outbound request the
landing page happens to make -- an OAuth login callback is exactly the kind
of page a Content-Security-Policy report, an analytics beacon, or a
third-party font/script load can leak that `Referer` from. **Fix: hand off
via a short-lived (60s), single-use opaque exchange code instead**
(`oauth_service.create_oauth_exchange_code`/`redeem_oauth_exchange_code`,
`hub_oauth_exchange_codes` table, migration 075) -- the code goes in the
URL, the frontend immediately redeems it for the real JWT via
`POST /api/v1/auth/exchange`, delivered over the response BODY. Single-use
is enforced the same way as `community_welcomed_users` (migration 068): an
atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE used = FALSE AND expires_at > NOW()` claim, not an
app-level check-then-act. Any future flow that hands a secret from a
redirect (magic links, SSO callbacks, etc.) should use this same
exchange-code pattern rather than a URL parameter. See
`tests/test_v1_auth_blueprint.py`'s `TestOAuthExchangeCodeHandoff` for the
fail-first regression tests.

## What M1 does NOT cover (explicit scope boundaries, not gaps)

- OAuth is scoped to Discord/Twitch/Slack (`flask_core.auth.
  OAUTH_PROVIDERS`'s own coverage) -- Node's `youtube`/`kick` support is
  not ported. Add them to `oauth_service.py`'s `VALID_PLATFORMS` +
  provider-URL tables if/when a group needs them.
- `profileController.js`'s `getPublicProfile`/`getMemberProfile` (mounted
  under `public.js`/`community.js` in Node, not `user.js`) belong to the
  Public/Tenancy groups, not M1 -- only the self-service subset
  (`getMyProfile` and friends) is ported here.
- `authController.js`'s `linkOAuth()` (legacy temp-password OAuth
  linking) is dead code under the current unified-session model (writes
  a field, `req.user.platformUserId`, that `createSession()` never sets)
  -- ported as an honest `501`, not a faithful reproduction of a
  guaranteed-broken code path. Confirm with product whether this route
  can be retired from the v1 contract entirely.
- Email delivery (Node's `sendVerificationEmail()`) is not wired --
  hub-api has no SMTP/email client dependency yet. Verification tokens
  are generated and stored regardless, so `verify_email()` is fully
  functional once a caller has the token; only the "send it" transport
  leg is missing.
- `userManagementController.js`'s `getUserDeletionRequest()` queries
  `data_deletion_requests`, a table owned by the Privacy/Compliance group
  (M3) and not bound in `services/schema.py` -- still uses a raw-SQL
  `%s` query (Gotcha #1 applies) and is untested against sqlite. Convert
  it and bind the table when M3 lands, or sooner if you need it tested.
