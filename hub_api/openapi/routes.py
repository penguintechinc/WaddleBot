"""OpenAPI document routes -- the public one, and the full one, gated identically to the API.

Two routes, two trust levels (backend.md OpenAPI):

- `GET /openapi/v1-public.json` -- unauthenticated, exactly the one path
  `spec_builder.build_public_login_spec` describes.
- `GET /openapi/v1.json` -- the complete, generated document (every
  mounted route, `quart_schema`'s own introspection), behind
  `tenant_middleware` + `require_scope` -- the SAME auth chain as any
  other protected hub-api route, not a bespoke check. This is what the
  default (disabled here -- see `app.py`'s `QuartSchema(..., openapi_path=
  None, swagger_ui_path=None, ...)`) `/openapi.json`/`/docs` routes would
  have served unauthenticated; mounting it behind auth instead is the
  entire fix.
