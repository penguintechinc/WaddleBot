"""Live-activity feed -- recent bot interaction events + the SSE poll generator.

`live_activity_events` (frozen contract this port task was given: `id
BIGSERIAL PK, community_id INT NOT NULL, platform VARCHAR(50), actor
VARCHAR(255), message_in TEXT, reply_out TEXT, channel_id VARCHAR(255),
occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ`) is a brand-new table for the WebUI's live
activity feed -- no existing migration owns it yet; `_ensure_table()`
below only maps pydal onto it (`migrate=False` in production, matching
every `bind_*_tables()` convention documented in `services/schema.py`).
Bound locally in THIS module rather than added to the shared
`services/schema.py`/`app.py::_bind_reference_tables` -- this task's
scope is "new files only" (the same per-group isolation boundary every
`bind_*_tables()` docstring in `schema.py` already cites for the
parallel port wave), so a brand-new, single-owner table gets its own
idempotent bind function instead of touching a file every other group
also edits.

Two read surfaces share this module (`blueprints/v1/live_activity.py`):
a bounded-`limit` list (`GET .../live-activity`) and an SSE polling
stream (`GET .../live-activity/stream`, `~1s` poll cadence). Both use
plain synchronous `dal` calls -- mirrors `services/community_common.py`'s
own documented convention (raw pydal, not `AsyncDAL.*_async()`; see this
repo's mem0 notes on `select_async()`/AsyncDAL concurrency gotchas) --
wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` only in the SSE loop, where the same
query re-runs roughly once a second for the lifetime of a client
connection: blocking the shared event loop on every poll iteration is a
real responsiveness cost that a single per-request call (the list
endpoint) doesn't have.
