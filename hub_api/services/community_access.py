"""Community-membership authorization -- the IDOR/token-takeover fix this port group adds.

Node's `requireCommunityAdmin` middleware (`admin/hub_module/backend/src/
middleware/auth.js`) verifies the caller is an active owner/admin member
of the exact `:communityId` in the URL before `overlayController.js`'s
four routes run -- every one of them is mounted behind it in `admin.js`.
`hub_api/PORTING.md`'s documented Auth pattern table only covers
tenant+scope (`tenant_middleware` + `require_scope`), which is NOT the
same guarantee: a caller holding a global `streaming.overlay:admin` /
`streaming.calls:admin` scope grant would pass `require_scope` for ANY
`community_id` path parameter -- including one in a different tenant
entirely, or one they have no membership in at all. Overlay URLs
(unguessable but not access-controlled) and RTC join tokens (a live
LiveKit credential) are exactly what security.md's Output Validation and
Service-to-Service Auth sections both warn against minting for the wrong
caller. `require_community_admin()`/`require_community_member()` below
are this group's own addition, layered strictly AFTER `tenant_middleware`
/`require_scope`, never a replacement for either.

Worse gap, member-facing surface: Node's `memberVoiceRouter`
(`routes/calls.js`) applies `requireAuth` ONLY -- no community-membership
check of any kind -- to `POST .../voice/rooms/:roomName/join`. ANY
authenticated user, member of the target community or not, could mint a
LiveKit join token for ANY `community_id` by supplying it in the URL.
`require_community_member()` closes this; ported in
`blueprints/v1/calls.py`.

Simplification vs. Node's full model (documented, not silently dropped --
`hub_api/PORTING.md` Gotcha #4's own precedent for "document, don't
silently invent"): Node resolves the caller's admin-ness via a
`community_roles.base_claims` JSON scopes join
(`community:manage_members` / `community:manage_channels`); this port
checks `community_members.role` directly against the two system-seeded
admin-tier role names instead (`communityController.js`/
`adminController.js`/`platformController.js` all also check
`role === 'community-owner'` directly in several places, so this is not
an invented convention). Binding `community_roles` +
`hub_channel_permission_overrides` for a claims graph neither overlay
nor calls otherwise needs is out of scope for this port group.
