"""Metered token billing -- the third metering axis (node/seat/token).

Real pydal ledger, owned by hub-api's marketplace module (NOT the
license-server -- see `critical-rules.md` "Licensing Model: Nodes &
Seats"). Advertised feature: premium metered consumables (e.g. an
AI-routing feature spends tokens per call). Schema: migration 076
(`token_products`, `community_token_balances`, `token_transactions` --
see that migration's own docstring for the full rationale).

**Atomicity -- a single combined executor job, NOT `transaction_async()`.**
`debit_tokens()`/`credit_tokens()` each submit ONE synchronous function
(`_guarded_debit_sync`/`_guarded_credit_sync`) to `AsyncDAL`'s own
`ThreadPoolExecutor` via `loop.run_in_executor()` -- the guarded UPDATE,
the balance re-read, the ledger INSERT, and the COMMIT all happen inside
that one submitted callable, with no `await` anywhere in the middle of
it. A `ThreadPoolExecutor` worker runs one submitted callable to
completion before picking up the next, so this whole sequence is
uninterruptible by any other coroutine's own submitted job -- including
another concurrent `debit_tokens()` call for the SAME `(community_id,
product_id)` pair.

This was NOT the first design tried. The obvious-looking
`async with async_dal.transaction_async(): await update_async(...); ...
await insert_async(...)` shape (i.e. `AsyncDAL.update_async()`/
`insert_async()`/`transaction_async()` used individually, each a
SEPARATE executor submission with `await` points in between) was tried
first and FAILED under `TestConcurrentDebitsDoNotOversell`'s own
concurrency test: `transaction_async()`'s commit/rollback act on
`self.dal`'s single ambient (thread-local, connection-scoped) transaction
state, not a transaction scoped to just the current coroutine's own
writes. With `pool_size=1` (this suite's own file-backed-sqlite fixture,
`hub_api/PORTING.md`'s `auth_db` gotcha) every concurrent `debit_tokens()`
call's executor submissions interleave on the SAME single worker
thread/connection -- so one coroutine's blocked-debit rollback (nothing
of ITS OWN to undo) instead rolled back OTHER, concurrently-in-flight
coroutines' successful, not-yet-committed decrements too. Confirmed
empirically: the first version of this test failed with the community's
final balance still at its STARTING value even though 10 of 25 debits
reported `ok=True` -- their writes existed only until a later sibling
coroutine's `transaction_async()` rollback wiped the whole shared
transaction. Bundling everything (including the commit) into one
executor-submitted synchronous function removes the multi-`await`
window entirely, so no sibling coroutine's job can ever run "in the
middle" of another's guarded update + ledger write + commit.

The WHERE-guarded UPDATE itself (`balance >= amount` alongside
`balance = balance - amount` in the SAME statement) is still what makes
this the "database, not application logic, arbitrates the race" pattern
`hub_oauth_exchange_codes` (migration 075) and `community_welcomed_users`
(migration 068) already established for single-use claims -- that
property holds independent of the executor-job restructuring above, and
is also what keeps this correct against a real multi-connection Postgres
pool in production (row-level locking serializes two concurrent UPDATEs
against the same row regardless of which connection issues them). The
`community_token_balances.balance >= 0` CHECK constraint (migration 076)
is a second, DB-level backstop against the same class of bug.

**BLOCK-WITH-FALLBACK enforcement.** `debit_tokens()` never raises to its
caller and never silently allows an under-funded spend:
  - Insufficient balance -> `TokenLedgerResult(ok=False,
    blocked_reason=REASON_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE)` -- the caller (e.g.
    premium-AI routing) checks `.ok` and denies the metered action with a
    refill/upgrade path, exactly like `blueprints/v1/token_billing.py`'s
    `debit_tokens` route does for the HTTP caller (402 Payment Required +
    `upgrade_path`).
  - Ledger DB unavailable (any exception from the DAL call chain) ->
    `TokenLedgerResult(ok=False, blocked_reason=REASON_LEDGER_UNAVAILABLE)`
    -- fail CLOSED (deny the spend) rather than fail open, logged via
    `logger.error`, never propagated as an unhandled exception that would
    crash the calling feature.

Per `hub_api/PORTING.md` Gotcha #1: pydal query builder only, no raw SQL
(`%s`-placeholder helpers are Postgres-only and 500 against sqlite in
tests). Per Gotcha #2: pydal never autocommits -- both guarded-write
helpers below call `dal.commit()` themselves as their last step.
