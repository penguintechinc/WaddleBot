"""Shared SSRF guard -- promoted from `bot_rcon.py`'s original `is_private_host`.

Two call sites need the identical check: `bot_rcon.py` (validates a
user-supplied RCON `host` at server-create/update time) and
`bot_ai_knowledge.py` (validates user-supplied knowledge-source URLs at
both write time and crawl/fetch time -- the crawler fetches
`sitemap.xml`, every `<loc>` URL found inside it, and the GitHub
Contents API, all server-side, on a user-controlled origin for the
`mkdocs`/`docusaurus`/`generic_url` source types). One guard, reused,
per security.md's "no reimplemented equivalents" and this repo's own
"promote, don't duplicate" precedent (`app_bundle_tables.py`, `bot_tables.py`).

Security posture (fail closed throughout):
- Scheme allowlist: `http`/`https` only -- rejects `file://`, `gopher://`,
  `ftp://`, etc. outright (SSRF via alternate scheme handlers).
- Hostname resolution: every literal IP AND every hostname is resolved
  via `socket.getaddrinfo()` (not a regex over the string) -- a hostname
  that currently resolves to a public IP but is switched to resolve to
  an internal one after the check (DNS rebind) is still caught at fetch
  time because the guard runs immediately before every request AND
  before following every redirect, not just once at write time.
- Disallowed ranges: loopback (127/8, ::1), link-local (169.254/16
  including the cloud-metadata address, fe80::/10), RFC 1918 private
  (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), IPv6 ULA (fc00::/7), `0.0.0.0/8`, and
  multicast. Python's `ipaddress.*.is_private` already covers loopback/
  link-local/RFC1918/`0.0.0.0/8`/ULA in one property (verified against
  every range this module's docstring lists); `is_multicast` is checked
  separately since `is_private` does not imply it. IPv4-mapped IPv6
  addresses (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`, a classic SSRF-filter bypass) are
  correctly classified `is_private=True` by the stdlib and therefore
  caught here too.
- A hostname that fails to resolve at all is treated as disallowed
  (fail closed) -- an unverifiable target is never fetched.

`validate_outbound_url()` below is a second, independent entry point added
by the M7 Streaming port group for its own two write paths --
`music_service.add_radio_station()`'s `url` field (an Icecast/Shoutcast
stream URL) and `streaming_proxy_service.add_destination()`'s `rtmpUrl`
(an RTMP forward-target, relayed to `video_proxy_module`, which opens the
real outbound RTMP connection) -- neither is `http(s)`-only like
`validate_url()`/`guarded_get()` above assume (RTMP has its own scheme),
so it takes its own `allowed_schemes` and returns the validated URL rather
than raising a fetch-oriented `SSRFError`; kept alongside rather than
folded into `validate_url()` to avoid changing that function's already-
relied-upon `http(s)`-only contract for `bot_rcon.py`/`bot_ai_knowledge.py`.
Resolution logic (`_is_blocked_ip`/`_resolve_and_check_sync`) is
deliberately independent of `_is_disallowed_ip`/`is_private_host` above
for the same reason -- see this module's own git history for the
pre-merge, single-owner version of each half.
