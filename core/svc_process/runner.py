"""svc-process's real poll -> pull -> transform -> enqueue loop.

Mirrors `core/svc_ingest/runner.py`'s shape exactly, one stage over: RPOPs
each active bundle's `:process` Valkey key, runs the bundle's real
`transform()` entrypoint, and LPUSHes the result onto that bundle's
`:action` key as a JSON `StageEnvelope` -- the task's explicit requirement
("enqueue to `waddles:t:{tenant}:c:{community}:app:{app_id}:action`").
Separated from `app.py` for direct unit-testability, same rationale as
svc-ingest's own `runner.py`.

Wire contract (frozen, `flask_core.stream_pipeline`): the `:process` key
carries `json.dumps(StageEnvelope.to_dict())` strings; this runner reads
one with `StageEnvelope.from_dict(json.loads(raw))`, hands the carried
`PlatformEvent` to the bundle's `transform(event) -> PlatformEvent | None`
entrypoint, and writes the result back as a new `StageEnvelope` (`stage=
"action"`) onto the `:action` key the same way. Malformed input raises
`EnvelopeError` (a `ValueError` subclass) from `from_dict` -- caught here
per-event so one bad message never kills the poll loop.

A transform may return `None` to mean "no reply" -- e.g. a chat bot bundle
that only responds to commands/keywords and must not echo every message
back to the channel. `None` is logged (`process.no_reply`) and the event is
simply dropped -- nothing is enqueued to the `:action` key for it.

Every `transform_fn` call is wrapped in `flask_core.bundle_context()`
(tenant/community/app_id from the envelope just popped) -- `transform`'s
own frozen signature carries only the bare `PlatformEvent`, not the
envelope, so a stateful bundle reaches its tenant/community scope via
`flask_core.get_bundle_context()` from inside its own body instead (see
docs/APP_BUNDLE_AUTHORING.md, 'Accessing the database / shared state').

Cross-app routing (gh #298, `flask_core.PROCESS_TARGET_APP_ID_KEY`): a
transform's returned event may carry a reserved payload key requesting its
result be enqueued onto a DIFFERENT app's `:action` key than the
originating bundle's own (e.g. `bot_process` delegating `!forum` to the
community-forums feature bundle, whose action handler actually persists
the post). This runner pops that key back out of the payload -- it never
leaks into the enqueued event's real data -- and, when present, computes
the destination `:action` key from `target_app_id` instead of `bundle.
app_id`. `tenant`/`community` are unaffected either way: they still come
solely from `envelope_in` (itself sourced from `get_bundle_context()`
upstream), never from event payload -- `target_app_id` changes the
destination QUEUE KEY only, not the tenancy scope.

Board-demo live activity feed: after a successful (non-raising) transform,
`_emit_activity()` writes one best-effort `live_activity_events` row (inbound
message + the bot's reply, or `None` for no-reply) via `services.
activity_feed.record_activity`, so the live WebUI feed can show it. This is
pure telemetry, never load-bearing -- any failure (no DAL bound, DB error,
bad data) is caught broadly and logged; the pipeline still enqueues the
reply (if any) to the `:action` key and returns normally either way.

Content-moderation gate (P1, docs/plans/2026-09-08-content-moderation-
design.md): `services.moderation_gate.run_moderation_gate` runs inside the
same `bundle_context()` block, BEFORE `transform_fn` -- a mandatory gate,
not a bundle, so no community can individually opt out short of the
master PostHog flag. P1 is observe-safe: on a classifier match it logs and
applies a reputation hit (`core/reputation_module`'s already-fixed gh #299
`ReputationService.adjust()`), never blocks or alters the message -- every
one of its own failure modes (flag check, DB read, classifier, reputation
write) is caught internally and never propagates here, so it can never be
the reason a message fails to reach `transform_fn`.
