"""Real command+keyword chat bot -- process-stage bundle replacing `echo_process`.

Referenced by `app_catalog.stages.process.entrypoint` (migration 084) as
`"bundles.bot_process:transform"` for `waddles.bot.discord.default` and
`waddles.bot.twitch.default`. Platform-agnostic: the same command/keyword
logic runs for Discord and Twitch, driven only by `event.payload["text"]`,
`event.actor`, and `event.platform` -- no platform-specific branching beyond
interpolating `event.platform` into the `!waddle` reply string.

Three response paths, tried in order:
  - `!command [args]` -- the bot's own built-in commands: Fun (roll/dice/
    flip/coin/8ball/hug/love/lurk), Utility (ping/hello/help/echo/waddle/
    uptime/time/rules/bot), and Community (socials/discord/so/followage),
    all handled locally -- see `_HELP_FUN`/`_HELP_UTILITY`/
    `_HELP_COMMUNITY_BUILTIN` and `_handle_command()`.
  - `!<feature-prefix> ...` -- COMMAND ROUTER (board-demo crunch): dispatches
    to a sibling process-stage feature bundle's `transform(event)` in-process
    (`_FEATURE_TRANSFORMS`, built by `_load_feature_transforms()` below) and
    returns its reply. This is what makes `!quote`, `!alias`, `!poll`,
    `!announce`, `!forum`, `!chat-history`, `!channels`, and `!reputation`/
    `!rep` actually respond in live Discord/Twitch -- today only the bot's
    own app_id is routed a message, so these feature bundles (separate
    app_ids) otherwise never run.
  - keyword/greeting responder -- a small set of conversational triggers
    (greeting, bot-name mention, thanks) get a short reply; everything else
    returns `None` (no reply) so the bot never echoes random chatter back
    to the channel.

BULLETPROOF CORE (non-negotiable): the bot's own commands and the pipeline
must survive a broken feature. Two guards enforce this:
  - Guarded IMPORT (`_load_feature_transforms`) -- a feature module that
    fails to import is logged and excluded from the dispatch table; every
    other feature and the bot's own commands are unaffected.
  - Guarded DISPATCH (`_dispatch_feature`) -- a feature `transform()` that
    raises is caught, logged, and turned into a short graceful reply (never
    propagated into `bot_process`/the pipeline).
