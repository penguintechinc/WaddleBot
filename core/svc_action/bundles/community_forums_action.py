"""Community forums action bundle -- persists forum posts/replies and relays.

Handles creation of forum posts and replies with best-effort relay to
bridged channels. Reads structured forum commands from process stage,
writes to hub_forum_posts/hub_forum_replies tables, and notifies relay
service for cross-platform propagation.

DB access uses `flask_core.get_bundle_dal()` per docs/APP_BUNDLE_AUTHORING.md
Accessing the database / shared state -- the runner binds the real,
env-sourced DAL at startup via `set_bundle_dal()` (`core/svc_action/app.py`),
same as every other action bundle (`community_announcements_action.py`,
`social_quote_action.py`).
