-- Migration 081: First-run admin bootstrap + default hub_settings/cookie
-- policy, migrated out of admin/hub_module/backend/src/index.js's
-- initializeDatabase(). That function is now skipped in every deployment
-- (docker-compose.yml/Helm set SKIP_DB_INIT=true) because it unconditionally
-- ran CREATE TABLE/INDEX/ALTER against tables it does not own -- most
-- notably `CREATE INDEX ... ON hub_chat_messages`, which 500s with
-- "must be owner of table hub_chat_messages" (hub_admin only owns
-- hub_users/hub_settings, granted by config/postgres/init.sql; every other
-- app table is owned by the migration-runner role that runs this file).
-- These SQL migrations already own the schema (as documented in
-- hub_api/PORTING.md's "the house pattern") -- so the one thing
-- initializeDatabase() did that SQL migrations don't yet cover, the
-- one-time first-run admin-user + default-settings seed, moves here instead
-- of being silently lost when SKIP_DB_INIT=true.
--
-- SECURITY (CWE-798, OWASP A07): this migration NEVER plants a default or
-- known credential. It creates an initial super-admin ONLY when both
-- waddlebot.initial_admin_email / waddlebot.initial_admin_password custom
-- GUCs are populated (from the INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL / INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD
-- process env vars -- see alembic/versions/0001_baseline_from_sql_migrations.py
-- and config/postgres/migrations/run-migrations.sh, which both set these
-- GUCs via `SELECT set_config(...)` before this file runs, in whichever
-- execution path applies) AND only if no super-admin exists yet. If the env
-- vars are unset, NO admin account is created -- boot continues normally.
--
-- Uses pgcrypto's crypt(..., gen_salt('bf', 12)) to produce a real bcrypt
-- hash ($2a$/$2b$) -- interoperable with Node's `bcrypt` package
-- (admin/hub_module/backend/src/utils/adminBootstrap.js calls
-- bcrypt.compare() against whatever is in password_hash; bcrypt's hash
-- format isn't implementation-specific).
